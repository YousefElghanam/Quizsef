# QUIZSEF
#### Video Demo: 
#### Description:

Quizsef is a web-based quiz application made for teachers and students. Teachers can use Quizsef to make exams
for students to answer, and view student submissions of each of their exams. Students can use QUizsef to browse
all available exams and submit answers for any of those exams.

Technologies used:
	Python: Main programming language for handling authentication, sessions, correctness of submitted
			forms, storing information in the database, rendering templates, redirects and more.
			The decision to choose python was easy for me, the main deciding factor was that I worked with
			python in the previous CS50 Problem Set, using the Flask framework, other reasons may include
			simplicity of python code and it being beginner friendly, Flask itself and others.

	Flask: The main framework used for making the web application.
	
	HTML, CSS: You know.
	
	VSCode: Easy to use editor, many extensions to choose from and make my code writing experience much easier.

	Google Chrome: Google Chrome.

	Windows 11: It's what I have ðŸ¤·.


Websites that hepled me:
	w3schools.com: A really good source to learn different languages, with examples and a built-in compiler.
	
	palletsprojects.com/p/flask: Flasks' documentation.

	stackoverflow.com: Search google for help when you have errors or bugs in your code, and you'll probably
					end up here with a very specific answer.

The following files can be found inside of the main directory:

==> run.py

	This file is used to run the application, that is by running flask.
	It imports app variable from __init__.py inside the app's package.
	Run this file to start the application.
